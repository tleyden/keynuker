:toc: left
:toclevels: 3


== Requirements overview

- https://github.com/apache/incubator-openwhisk[Apache OpenWhisk] -- these docs assume you are using OpenWhisk on hosted Bluemix
- CouchDB REST API compatible database -- these docs assume you are using Cloudant on hosted Bluemix
- An AWS account in the organization you want to monitor, with permissions to create IAM users
- Github account and access token
- Go 1.8 and Python 2.x installed locally

== Signup for Bluemix free tier

. Signup for the http://www.bluemix.net[IBM Bluemix cloud] -- the free tier is good enough to get things running.
. Download and install the OpenWhisk CLI

It's also possible to get this running locally using the https://github.com/apache/incubator-openwhisk[Open Source version of OpenWhisk], but there aren't instructions for that yet.

== Create AWS user with minimal IAM permissions

In the AWS web admin UI, create a new IAM user called `KeyNuker` with only **Programmatic access** and assign that user the following policy:

```
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "Stmt1499788629000",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "iam:DeleteAccessKey",
                "iam:ListAccessKeys",
                "iam:ListUsers"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "*"
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

Then under **Security credentials**, click the **Create access key** button to create a new AWS Access Key and Secret, which you should use to set the environment variable `TARGET_AWS_ACCOUNTS` as described below

== Generate a github access token

Login to github and go to https://github.com/settings/tokens/new[generate an access token].  The only permission needed is the `read:org` (Read org and team membership) permission.  You should be logged in as a user that is a **member** of the Github organization(s) that you want to monitor user activity for.

You should set this in an environment variable called `GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN`

Decide which github orgs you want to monitor, and set the `GITHUB_ORGS` environment variable accordingly.  If you want to monitor non-public users on those orgs (highly recommended), your `GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN` will need to be owned by a user that is a member of those github orgs.

== Create a CouchDB compatible database

=== Cloudant ===

In the bluemix web console:

- Create a new Cloudant service
- Create a db named `keynuker`.  Set the `KEYNUKER_DB_NAME` environment variable to `keynuker`
- Click the **API** button to get the API URL, and set the host part of the url to `KEYNUKER_DB_HOST`.  This should not include the leading `http` or `https`.
- Click the database name to go to the dashboard for that database
- Go to the **Permissions** section and **Generate API key**
- Save the **Key** to the `KEYNUKER_DB_KEY` environment variable, and the **Password** to the `KEYNUKER_DB_SECRET_KEY` environment variable

Alternatively, you should be able to use your own self-hosted Apache CouchDB or https://github.com/couchbase/sync_gateway[Couchbase Sync Gateway] (which has a REST API that is mostly compatible with Apache CouchDB)

== Environment variables

This is the full list of environment variables you should have set from the above steps.  These will be used by the commands in this document, such as `install.py`

.Environment variables
|===
|Variable |Example |Description

|KEYNUKER_ORG
|default
|The keynuker org (multi-tenancy).  Set this to "default" unless you are trying to juggle multiple environments.

|KEYNUKER_DB_KEY
|jhh343234jkk
|DB access key

|KEYNUKER_DB_SECRET_KEY
|7a789888djhh343234jkk
|DB secret access key

|KEYNUKER_DB_HOST
|787877rrr-021d-42dc-6c65-gjhg775b2ef-bluemix.cloudant.com
|DB hostname

|KEYNUKER_DB_NAME
|keynuker
|DB name

|TARGET_AWS_ACCOUNTS
|'[{"AwsAccessKeyId": "******", "AwsSecretAccessKey": "******"}]'
|AWS Access Key ID and secret of AWS account being monitored, only needs limited IAM permissions

|GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN
|902dcb6f5386e9f3ba
|Github access token which has the :org read permission

|GITHUB_ORGS
|'["acme", "acme-labs"]'
|The list of github orgs you would like to monitor.  The quoting is important: outer quotes as single quotes, inner quotes as double quotes

|===


== Install KeyNuker to OpenWhisk

=== Run install.py ===

The `install.py` script will do the following things:

. Build Go binaries from source
. Package binaries into `action.zip` files that are used by the executing docker container  (search install.py for `--docker` for details)
. Create (or recreate) all of the OpenWhish actions, triggers, and rules

```
$ python install.py
```

== Verify installation

=== List wsk actions

```
$ wsk action list
```

Should return a list of actions:

```
$ wsk action list
actions
/yourusername_dev/github-user-events-scanner-nuker                     private sequence
/yourusername_dev/fetch-aws-keys-write-doc                             private sequence
/yourusername_dev/github-user-aggregator-write-doc                     private sequence
/yourusername_dev/write-doc                                            private blackbox
/yourusername_dev/nuke-leaked-aws-keys                                 private blackbox
/yourusername_dev/lookup-github-users-aws-keys                         private blackbox
/yourusername_dev/github-user-events-scanner                           private blackbox
/yourusername_dev/github-user-aggregator                               private blackbox
/yourusername_dev/fetch-aws-keys                                       private blackbox
```


=== Manually invoke the github-user-events-scanner-nuker action sequence

First run the action that will fetch all AWS keys and store them in the database:

```
$ wsk action invoke fetch-aws-keys-write-doc --blocking --result
```

You should now have a doc in your database called `aws_keys_default`

Then run the action that will aggregate all github users in your org and store that in the database:

```
$ wsk action invoke github-user-aggregator-write-doc --blocking --result
```

You should now have a doc in your database called `github_users_default`

Invoke the action that will scan all recent events by the github users in `github_users_default` and look for leaked keys listed in `aws_keys_default`.

```
$ wsk action invoke github-user-events-scanner-nuker --blocking --result
```

Check the output, and assuming there weren't any leaked keys, you should see `"NukedKeyEvents": null,` in the returned JSON.  Also, you can see the latest scanned github event for each github user that was scanned.

== End-to-end system test: leak a live AWS key

=== Create IAM user with zero privileges

In the AWS web admin UI, create a new IAM user called `KeyLeaker` with only **Programmatic access** and don't assign the user *any* policy whatsoever -- you should see a warning **This user has no permissions**

=== Re-fetch AWS keys

To avoid waiting for the `fetch_aws_keys` polling loop, trigger a refresh immediately by running:

```
$ wsk action invoke fetch-aws-keys-write-doc --blocking --result
```

You should see the `KeyLeaker` user listed along with an associated `AccessKeyId`

=== Leak key to public or private github repo

After creating the `KeyLeaker` user, it will generate an access key and secret.  Post that to either:

* A public github repo using one of the github users in the org (presumably, your own github user account, which you are a member of the org)
* A private github repo.  For this approach, you not only have to be in the github org, but you will also have to use a github access token with more permissions (the full **repo** permissions) and then run `wsk action update github_user_events_scanner -p GithubAccessToken "new_token"`

==== Trigger Keynuker

```
$ wsk action invoke github-user-events-scanner-nuker --blocking --result
```

Or you can just wait 15 minutes for the alarm task to kick in


==== Verify key is nuked

* In the AWS web UI, if you reload the list of keys for the `KeyLeaker` user, it should be gone!
* If you triggered `github-user-events-scanner-nuker` manually, you should see a non-nil value in the `NukedKeyEvents` JSON field.  Otherwise if it was triggered via an alarm, you can find the activation id via `wsk activation list` and then view the logs via `wsk activation logs [activation_id]`
