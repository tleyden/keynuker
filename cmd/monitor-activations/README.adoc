Provide a REST API that will return "FAILED" if any any activations in the last 24 hours failed with:

```
"response": {
        "status": "action developer error",
        "statusCode": 0,
        "success": false,
        "result": {
            "error": "The action did not return a dictionary."
        }
    },
```

This can be then monitored by UptimeRobot to send alerts.
