:toc: left
:toclevels: 3


== Requirements overview

- https://github.com/apache/incubator-openwhisk[Apache OpenWhisk] -- these docs assume you are using OpenWhisk on hosted Bluemix
- CouchDB REST API compatible database -- these docs assume you are using Cloudant on hosted Bluemix
- An AWS account in the organization you want to monitor, with permissions to create IAM users
- Github account and access token
- Go 1.8 and Python 2.x installed locally

== Signup for Bluemix free tier

. Signup for the http://www.bluemix.net[IBM Bluemix cloud] -- the free tier is good enough to get things running.
. Download and install the OpenWhisk CLI

It's also possible to get this running locally using the https://github.com/apache/incubator-openwhisk[Open Source version of OpenWhisk], but there aren't instructions for that yet.

== IAM Setup

There are two ways to setup IAM Access to enable KeyNuker to pull in the latest AWS Access Keys from the AWS account(s) you want to protect:

. Direct: Setup an IAM User on the AWS target account, assign permissions, generate an Access Key and bake into KeyNuker parameters
. AssumeRole: This requires *two* separate AWS accounts.  KeyNuker will have a user in the "initiating" AWS account, and each account you want to monitor will need to have a special role to allow that separate account to access it.

=== Direct: Create AWS user with minimal IAM permissions

In the AWS web admin UI, create a new IAM user called `KeyNuker` with only **Programmatic access** and assign that user the following policy:

```
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "Stmt1499788629000",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "iam:DeleteAccessKey",
                "iam:ListAccessKeys",
                "iam:ListUsers"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "*"
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

NOTE: the most up-to-date version of this policy is in `docs/keynuker-iam-user-policy.yml`

Then under **Security credentials**, click the **Create access key** button to create a new AWS Access Key and Secret, which you should use to set the environment variable `TARGET_AWS_ACCOUNTS` as described below

Or to do the same steps via the CLI:

```
$ cd /path/to/keynuker
$ aws cloudformation create-stack --stack-name KeyNukerIAMAccess --template-body file://docs/cloudformation/keynuker-iam-user-policy.yml --capabilities CAPABILITY_IAM CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM
$ aws cloudformation describe-stacks --stack-name KeyNukerIAMAccess --query 'Stacks[0].Outputs[?OutputKey==`AwsAccessKey`].OutputValue' --output text
$ aws cloudformation describe-stacks --stack-name KeyNukerIAMAccess --query 'Stacks[0].Outputs[?OutputKey==`AwsSecretAccessKey`].OutputValue' --output text
```

=== AssumeRole: Add a role/policy with cross-account STS AssumeRole ability

This is in a separate document: link:setup_assume_role.adoc[Add a role/policy with cross-account STS AssumeRole ability]

== Generate a github access token

Login to github and go to https://github.com/settings/tokens/new[generate an access token].  The only permission needed is the `read:org` (Read org and team membership) permission.  You should be logged in as a user that is a **member** of the Github organization(s) that you want to monitor user activity for.

You should set this in an environment variable called `GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN`

Decide which github orgs you want to monitor, and set the `GITHUB_ORGS` environment variable accordingly.  If you want to monitor non-public users on those orgs (highly recommended), your `GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN` will need to be owned by a user that is a member of those github orgs.

== Create a CouchDB compatible database

=== Cloudant ===

In the bluemix web console:

- Create a new Cloudant service
- Create a db named `keynuker`.  Set the `KEYNUKER_DB_NAME` environment variable to `keynuker`
- Click the **API** button to get the API URL, and set the host part of the url to `KEYNUKER_DB_HOST`.  This should not include the leading `http` or `https`.
- Click the database name to go to the dashboard for that database
- Go to the **Permissions** section and **Generate API key**
- Save the **Key** to the `KEYNUKER_DB_KEY` environment variable, and the **Password** to the `KEYNUKER_DB_SECRET_KEY` environment variable

Alternatively, you should be able to use your own self-hosted Apache CouchDB or https://github.com/couchbase/sync_gateway[Couchbase Sync Gateway] (which has a REST API that is mostly compatible with Apache CouchDB)

== Environment variables

This is the full list of environment variables you should have set from the above steps.  These will be used by the commands in this document, such as `install.py`

.Environment variables

== Install KeyNuker to OpenWhisk

=== Get the code

```
$ go get -u -v -t github.com/tleyden/keynuker
```

=== Run install.py ===

The `install.py` script will do the following things:

. Build Go binaries from source
. Package binaries into `action.zip` files that are used by the executing docker container  (search install.py for `--docker` for details)
. Create (or recreate) all of the OpenWhish actions, triggers, and rules

```
$ cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/tleyden/keynuker/
$ python install.py
```

Congrats!  KeyNuker is now installed.  You can do a quick verification by running `wsk action list`, which should return a list of actions:

```
$ wsk action list
actions
/yourusername_dev/github-user-events-scanner-nuker                     private sequence
/yourusername_dev/fetch-aws-keys-write-doc                             private sequence
etc ...
```
